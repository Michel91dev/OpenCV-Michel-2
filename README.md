# OpenCV-Michel-1

I'm using Friolator Project "https://github.com/friolator/xojo-opencvc" (Many thanks)as a base for this Xojo Project that I will make evolve to learn the usage of OpenCV with Xojo on Mac.
I'm not sure if this is can be useful for anyone... üôÑ

 I'm a **Mac** user and this project is for Mac

‚ö†Ô∏è in the original project the "libOpenCVC.dylib" build option is set to "INTEL", this got me crazy for several hours until (with the help of a friend) I saw this.
I made a local fork https://github.com/Michel91dev/OpenCV-C-main-Modif-Michel- to make gradually some modification to the OpenCV-C version that Friolator did.

1) As of 2023 0405, I added the WebCam number to work which allow to chose the Webcam to be used (and multiple camera at the same time too)
2) The Dynamic Library libOpenCVC.dylib also work not for Intel as well as ARM MAc Computers
